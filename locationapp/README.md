If all the members of the NGO have access to this app then all them gets a notification to remainder on passing by a certain location where he wishes to buy certain product.


## GETTING STARTED:
      Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you're developing on Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device. For help installing drivers, see the OEM USB Drivers document.
Enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer options.
Note: On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it available, go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times. Return to the previous screen to find Developer options.

            Run the app from Android Studio as follows:

      In Android Studio, click the app module in the Project window and then select Run > Run (or click Run  in the toolbar).
In the Select Deployment Target window, select your device, and click OK.
Android Studio installs the app on your connected device and starts it.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
